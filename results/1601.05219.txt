Regularity of solutions in semilinear elliptic
theory

E. Indrei, A. Minne, L. Nurbekyan

Abstract

We study the semilinear Poisson equation
Au=f(z,u) in By. (1)

Our main results provide conditions on f which ensure that weak solutions
of belong to C’"(B1/2). In some configurations, the conditions are
sharp.

1 Introduction

The semilinear Poisson equation encodes stationary states of the nonlinear
heat, wave, and Schrédinger equation. In the case when f is the Heaviside
function in the u-variable, (I) reduces to the classical obstacle problem. For an
introduction to classical semilinear theory, see {Caz06}.

It is well-known that weak solutions of (1) belong to the usual Sobolev space
W??(By/2) for any 1 < p < co provided f € L®. Recent research activity has
thus focused on identifying conditions on f which ensure W?°(By/2) regularity
of wu.

1.1. The classical theory

There are simple examples which illustrate that continuity of f = f(x) does
not necessarily imply that uw has bounded second derivatives: for p € (0,1) and
x € R® such that |x| < 1, the function

u(x) = 21 %2(— log |x|)?

has a continuous Laplacian but is not in Cl! [Shal5]. However, if f is Hélder
continuous, then it is well-known that u € C?*; if f is Dini continuous, then
ue C? [Kov99]. The sharp condition which guarantees bounded second
derivatives of u is the C1! regularity of f * N where N is the Newtonian po-
tential and « denotes convolution; this requirement is strictly weaker than Dini
continuity of f.

In the general case, the state-of-the-art is a theorem of Shahgholian
which states that u € Cl! whenever f = f(z,u) is Lipschitz in 2, uniformly


in u, and 0,f > —C weakly for some C € R. In some configurations this
illustrates regularity for continuous functions f = f (wu) which are strictly below
the classical Dini-threshold in the u-variable, e.g. the odd reflection of

1
log(t)

about the origin. Shahgholian’s theorem is proved via the celebrated Alt-
Caffarelli-Friedman (ACF) monotonicity formula and it seems difficult to weaken
the assumptions by this method. On the other hand, Koch and Nadirashvili
[KN] recently constructed an example which illustrates that the continuity of f
is not sufficient to deduce that weak solutions of Au = f(u) are in Ct.

We say f = f(x, u) satisfies assumption A provided that f is Dini continuous
in u, uniformly in x, and has a C!! Newtonian potential in 2, uniformly in u
(see §3). One of our main results is the following statement.

f(t) =

Theorem 1.1. Suppose f satisfies assumption A. Then any solution of (I) is
Ch! in By /2-

Our assumption includes functions which fail to satisfy both conditions in
Shahgholian’s theorem, e.g.
Ly
log(|2|)(~ log |a{)?’

for p > 1, # = (a1, 22) € By; and t € (—1,1). The Newtonian potential assump-
tion in the x-variable is essentially sharp whereas the condition in the t-variable

f(x1,%2,t) =

is in general not comparable with Shahgholian’s assumption.

The proof of Theorem [1.]] does not invoke monotonicity formulas and is
self-contained. We consider the L? projection of D?u on the space of Hessians
generated by second order homogeneous harmonic polynomials on balls with

radius r > 0 and show that the projections stay uniformly bounded as r > 0*.
Although this approach has proven effective in dealing with a variety of free
boundary problems FS14 Theorem[L Jjillustrates that it is

also useful in extending and refining the classical elliptic theory.

1.2 Singular case: the free boundary theory

In §4 we study the PDE for functions f = f(z,u) which are discontinuous
in the u-variable at the origin.
If the discontinuity of f is a jump discontinuity, (I) has the structure

f(@,U) = gu (@,U)X {uso} + Galt, U)X {<0}; (2)
where gi, g2 are continuous functions such that
gi(x,0) Z g2(x,0), Vax € Bi,

and ye defines the indicator function of the set 2.


Our aim is to find the most general class of coefficients g; which generate
interior C1! regularity.

The classical obstacle problem is obtained by letting gi = 1,92 = 0, and it
is well-known that solutions have second derivatives in L°° [PSU12]. Neverthe-
less, by selecting gj = —1,g2 = 0, one obtains the so-called unstable obstacle
problem. Elliptic theory and the Sobolev embedding theorem imply that any
weak solution belongs to C1“ for any 0 < a < 1. It turns out that this is the
best one can hope for: there exists a solution which fails to be in C's! [AWO6].
Hence, if there is a jump at the origin, C1! regularity can hold only if the jump
is positive and this gives rise to:

Assumption B. gi(,0) — g2(#,0) > 00, x € By for some oo > 0.

The free boundary [ = 0{u 4 0} consists of two parts: T° =P {Vu = 0}
and T' = {Vu 4 0}. The main difficulty in proving C1! regularity is the
analysis of points where the gradient of the function vanishes. In this direction
we establish the following result.

Theorem 1.2. Suppose gi, g2 satisfy A_and B. Then if u is a solution of Q),
\Jullca 1K) < 0 for any K € By/2(0) \r.

At points where the gradient does not vanish, the implicit function theorem
yields that the free boundary is locally a Ch graph for any 0 < a < 1. The
solution u changes sign across the free boundary, hence it locally solves the
equation Au = gi(z,u) on the side where it is positive and Au = go(x,u) on
the side where it is negative. If the coefficients g; are regular enough to provide
C1! solutions up to the boundary — this is encoded in assumption C, see §4 —
then we obtain full C!+ regularity.

Theorem 1.3. Suppose gi, 92 satisfy A, B and C. Let u be a solution of
and0 €1°. Thenu € C'(B,,(0)), for some po > 0.

Equation () with right-hand side of the form @) is a generalization of the
well-studied two-phase membrane problem, where g;(z,u) = Ai(z), i = 1,2.
The C1! regularity in the case when A; > 0, Az < 0 are two constants satisfying
B was obtained by Uraltseva. via the ACF monotonicity formula. More-
over, Shahgholian proved this result for Lipschitz coefficients which satisfy B
Example 2]. If the coefficients are Hélder continuous, the ACF method
does not directly apply and under the stronger assumption that inf A; > 0 and
inf —A2 > 0, Edquist, Lindgren, Shahgholian obtained the Cl! regu-
larity via an analysis of blow-up limits and a classification of global solutions
(see also Remark 1.3]). Theorem [L.3]improves and extends this result.

The difficulty in the case when g; depend also on uw is that if v:= u+ L for
some linear function L, then v is no longer a solution to the same equation, so
one has to get around the lack of linear invariance. Our technique exploits that
linear perturbations do not affect certain L? projections.

The proof of Theorem [1.3] does not rely on classical monotonicity formulas
or classification of global solutions. Rather, our method is based on an identity


which provides monotonicity in r of the square of the L? norm of the projection
of u onto the space of second order homogeneous harmonic polynomials on the
sphere of radius r.

Theorems [1.2] & [E3] deal with the case when f has a jump discontinuity. If
f has a removable discontinuity, has the structure

Au = 9(0,u)xuzo- (3)

In this case, one may merge some observations in the proofs of the previous
results with the method in and prove the following theorem.

Theorem 1.4. If g satisfies assumption A, then every solution of B) is in
Ch (By /2).

Theorems{I.]]- [4] provide a comprehensive theory for the general semilinear
Poisson equation where the free boundary theory is encoded in the regularity
assumption of f in the u-variable.

2 Technical tools

Throughout the text, the right-hand side of (I) is assumed to be bounded. More-
over, Pz denotes the space of second order homogeneous harmonic polynomials.
A useful elementary fact is that all norms on P2 are equivalent.

Lemma 2.1. The space P2 is a finite dimensional linear space. Consequently,
all norms on P2 are equivalent.

For u € W??(B,), y € By and r € (0,dist(y,0.B,)), Uy(u,r) is defined to be

Calderon-Zygmund theory yields the following useful inequality for re-scalings
of weak solutions of (I).

Lemma 2.2. Let u solve (I), y € Bij2, andr < 1/4. Then for

u(ra + y) — ra: Vu(y) — u(y)

Two applications of Poincaré’s inequality together with the above estimate im-

Let ¢ := u, — Vu,-2—%,. We have that 4(0) = —w, and V¢(0) = —Vi;;
however, by the Sobolev embedding theorem, ¢ is C* and thus

|9(0)| + |Vo(0)| < Ca

completing the proof of the W?” estimate. The C! estimate likewise follows
from the Sobolev embedding theorem. o

Our analysis requires several additional simple technical lemmas involving the
projection operator.

Lemma 2.3. For any u € W??(By) and s € [1/2, 1],
I|Ho(u, s) — Mo(w, 1 l|z2unj < Cl|Aul|r2ca.),

and
||Ho(u, s) — Ho(w, 1)\|r2(a.) < Cl|Aullracay),

for some constant C = C(n).


Proof. Let f = Au and v be the Newtonian potential of f, i.e.

v(x) = 1 fY)xBW) jy.
n(n — 2)um J ja—y|r?

where w,, is the volume of the unit ball in R". Since u — v is harmonic,
TIp(u — v,s) = IIp(u — v, 1);

therefore
TIo(u, s) — Ho(u, 1) = Ilo(v, s) — To(v, 1).

Invoking bounds on the projection (e.g. Lemma. 3.2]) and Calderon-
Zygmund theory (e.g. Theorem 2.2]), it follows that

||To(u, s) — Mo(u, 1)|\r2¢8,) = ||Tlo(v, s) — Mo(v, 1)||z2¢2,)
< Cl|Av||r2(2,) = Cl|Aullz2(z,)-

The L™ bound follows from the equivalence of the norms in the space P2. O

Lemma 2.4. Let u solve (I). Then for all0 <r < 1/4, s € [1/2,1] and
ye Bis,
sup |I1,(u, rs) — ILy(u,r)| < C,

and

sup |II,(u,r)| < Clog(1/r),
By

for some constant C = C(n, || f||L°(2: x2) ||ullz2(e,))-

Proof. Note that
I,(u,rs) ~ Ty(u,r) = Hp(tip, 8) — Tp (tip, 1),

where Vv
ii,(z) = u(re + y) = ne u(y) = u(y)
r

as before. From Lemma [2.3] we have that
\|To(@-, 8) — Ho (tr, 1)||z°(8, x) < Cl|Atrl|n2(a,) < Cll fllz~(a.)-

As for the second inequality in the statement of the lemma let ro = 1/4 and
s € [1/2,1]. Then we have that

The previous tools imply a growth estimate on weak solutions solution of (I).
Lemma 2.5. Let u solve (I). Then for y € Bij andr > 0 small enough,
sup |u(x) — u(y) — (w — y)Vuy)| < Cr? log(1/r).
B,(y)
Proof. Let

u(ra + y) — ra: Vu(y) — u(y)
r ,
The assertion of the Lemma is equivalent to the estimate
\|@r|| n° (81) < Clog(1/r),
for r small enough. Lemma [24]and the C!® estimates of Lemma [J] imply

Up =

||@r lz (B,) S Ilr — Ty (u, 7) ILL (8,) + |Hy(u.r) || n° (8,)
< C+ Clog(1/r) < Clog(1/r),

provided r is small enough. o

Next lemma relates the boundedness of the projection operator and the bound-
edness of second derivatives of weak solutions of (I).

Lemma 2.6. Let u be a solution to (I). If for each y € By/2 there is a sequence
rj(y) + 0+ as j + co such that

M:= sup sup ||D*H,(u,rj(y))Ilb~(i)2) <

then
|D?u| <C ae. in Bio,
for some constant C = C(M,n, ||f\lL~(B, xx); |!UllL~(B,)) > 9-
Proof. Let y € Byjz be a Lebesgue point for D?u and rj; = rj;(y) > OF as
j > oo. Then by utilizing Lemma[2.2]

|D?u(y)| = lim |D?u(z)|\dz
I7*% J Br (y)

Since a.e. z € By/2 is a Lebesgue point for D?u, the proof is complete. im]

The following lemma records the basic properties enjoyed by this projection, cf.

Lemma 3.2].


Lemma 2.7. i. Qy(,r) is linear;
ii. if u is harmonic Qy(u, 8) = Qy(u,r) for all s <r;
iii. if u is a linear function then Q,(u,r) = 0;
iv. if u is a second order homogeneous polynomial then Qy(u,r) = us
v. ||Qo(u, 8) — Qo(u, 1)||z2(aB,) < Cs||Aullz2(B,), forO<s <1;
vi. ||Qo(u, D[lz2@B) < [lulle2@z,)-
Proof. i. This is evident.
ii. It suffices to prove Q,(u,r) = Qy(u, 1) for r < 1. Let

Qy (u, 1)

op =
Q,(u, )||z2~081)

and for i 4 2, let o; be an i‘” degree harmonic polynomial. Then there
exist coefficients a; such that

oo
u(@+y) = So aioi(z), x € OB;
i=0

@

in particular, a2 = ||Q,(u, 1)||. Let

v(x) = So aioi(z), x eé€ By.

i=0
Then v is a harmonic and u(x + y) = v(x) for « € OB,. Hence, we have
that u(x + y) = v(x) for x € B, and in particular

uat+y)= De aisi(e), ce B,.

Therefore

so Qy(u,r) = a02(x) = Q,(u, 1).
iii. & iv. These are evident.
v. Similar to Lemma 2.3}

vi. This follows from the fact that Qo(u, 1) is the L? projection of u.


Next we prove some technical results for Q,(u,r) and establish a precise
connection between IT,(u,r) and Q,(u,r) by showing that the difference is uni-
formly bounded in r.

3 C!! regularity: general case

In this section we utilize the previous technical tools and prove C1! regularity
provided that f = f(a,t) satisfies assumption A:
Assumption A.

|f(w,t2) — f(w,t1)| < h(w)w(lt2 — ti),

then

Remark 1. To generate examples, consider f(x,t) = ¢(x)~(t). If ¢ € L~ and w
is Dini, then f satisfies condition (i). If ¢* N is Cl! and y is locally bounded,
then f satisfies (ii). Thus if ¢* N is Cl! and y is Dini, then f satisfies both
conditions. In particular, f may be strictly weaker than Dini in the x-variable.
Remark 2. The projection Qy has similar properties to Il,. Consequently, if f
satisfies assumption A, (5) holds for II, replaced by Qy.

4 C!! regularity: discontinuous case
The goal of this section is to investigate the optimal regularity for solutions
of with f having a jump discontinuity in the t-variable. This case may be

viewed as a free boundary problem. The idea is to employ again an L? projection
operator.

4.1 Two-phase obstacle problem
Suppose f = f(x,u) has the form

F(x, U) = 91(@, U)X{us0} + 92(@, U)X{u<o};
where gi,g2 are continuous. We recall from the introduction that if f has a
jump in wu at the origin, then we assume it to be a positive jump:
Assumption B. gi(,0) — g2(#,0) > 00, x € By for some oo > 0.

Remark 3. In the unstable obstacle problem, i.e. g; = —1, go = 0, there exists
a solution which is Ch for any a € (0,1) but not Cl.

Let P° :-= TN {|Vu| = u = 0} and FP! :-= TN {|Vu| 4 O}. Our main result
provides optimal growth away from points with sufficiently small gradients.
Theorem 4.1. Suppose 91,92 € C® satisfy B. Then for all constants 0,M > 0
there exist ro(8,.M, ||91\|00; ||Galloo,m) > 0 and Co(9,M, ||g1I]o0- II9zll0.) > 0

for some constant Cy (0, M, ||91||<0, ||g2\|o0,) > 0.

The proof of the theorem is carried out in several steps. A crucial ingredient
is the following monotonicity result.

Lemma 4.2. Suppose gi, go € C®° satisfy B. Then for all constants 0,M > 0
there exist Ko(0,M, ||91||<0, ||g2||o0.m) > 0 and ro(O,M, |\|91||00, ||g2\|0,.n) > 0

Proof of Theorem [Z.1} Let ko and ro be the constants from Lemma [4.2]
Without loss of generality we can assume that ro < 1/4. From Lemmas [2.4] and
P12] we have that

1
1Q,(u, ro) llz2(aB,) < Clog i

for all y € By/2, where C = C(M, ||91||.0; ||g2lloo,™) is a constant. Take

1
Co = max (i. 2C log *) .

We claim that
|Q,y(u,7)||22(aB1) < Co,

forr < ro andy € By2NN{|Vuly)| < Or}. Let us fix y such that |Vu(y)| < Oro
and consider

T,(r) = lQy(u, r)||c2(aBy)
as a function of r on the interval V|u(y)|/@ <r < ro. Let
e:=inf{r s.t. Ty(r) < Co}. (8)

We have that T,(ro) < Co, so |Vu(y)|/@ < e < ro. Ife > |Vu(y)|/@ then
Ty(e) = Co and by Lemma [4.2] we have that T/(e) > 0, so Ty(r) < Co for
e—e <r <e which contradicts (8).

Therefore, e = |Vu(y)|/@ and T,(r) < Co for all |Vu(y)|/@ <r < ro which
proves (6).

Inequality (Z) follows from Lemmas [2.2] and [2.12] Oo

Theorem[Z. implies C1! regularity away from I! in the case the coefficients
gi are regular enough to provide C1! solutions away from the free boundary,

ie. Theorem [2]

Remark 4. Note that A is the condition given in Theorem[LJ] If g; only depend
on x, then this reduces to the assumption that the Newtonian potential of g; is
C1, which is sharp.

Proof of Theorem Suppose A and B hold. We show that for every 6 > 0

there exists Cs > 0 such that for all y € By/2(0) such that dist(y, T') > 6, there
exists ry > 0 such that

lQy(u,7)||L2(aBi@)) < Cs, (9)

for r< ry.
Consequently,

u(x) — u(y) — Vu(y)(a = y)| < C5|a = yl? (10)

for ja —y| <ry, y € Byy2(0) and dist(y,I') > 6; this readily yields the desired
result.

Note that follows from (9) via Lemmas [2.2] and [2.12]

Without loss of generality assume that 6 < ro, where ro > 0 is the constant
from Theorem[Z]] For every y € By/2(0) consider the ball Bs/2(y). Then there
are two possibilities.


i. Bsyo(y) nr? = 9.

In this case Bs/2 NT = 0, hence u satisfies the equation

Au=gile,u)

A yields

for r < 6/4.

ii, Bsjo(y) NT? ZO.
Let w € °° be such that d:= |y—w| = dist(y, I). We have that d < 6/2.
As before, assumption A yields

Qy(u.r)||2¢@B, (0) < Qy(u, d/2)||z2(aB, (0) + C(\|D?viyyylloo +L),

for r < d/2. From Theorem [4.1] we have that

The proof is now complete. im]

Lastly we point out that if the coefficients g; are regular enough to provide
C+! solutions at points where the gradient does not vanish, then we obtain full
interior C1! regularity.

Assumption C. For any M > 0 there exist 69(M, ||91|I00, ||gzllo0.n) > 0
and C3(M, ||g1||00; ||g2ll0, 2) > 0 such that for all z € By/z any solution of

Av = 91(2,v)Xxu>0 + 92(#,U)Xv<0, © € Byy2(z);
v(x)| <M, x € Byy2(z);

v dB, (2) continuous,

admits a bound
||D?o|

L® (Biya(z))/69 (2) S C3.

Remark 5. A sufficient condition which ensures C is that g; are Hélder contin-
uous, see Proposition 2.6] and Theorem 9.3]. The idea being
that at such points, the set {u = 0} is locally C1 (via the implicit function
theorem) and one may thereby reduce the problem to a classical PDE for which
up to the boundary estimates are known.

Theorem [Z.]] and C imply Theorem

Proof of Theorem [i.4 By Lemmas 22.12] and [2.6] the assertion follows if we
show that there exist po,C > 0 such that for every y € B,,(0) there exists
ry > 0 such that
lQy(u,r)llz2~@B,(0)) SC (11)
forO<r<ry.

Let po be such that |Vu(y)| < 4 for y € B,,(0), where 9 is the constant
from assumption C (we can do this because u is Ch® and 0 € T°). For y €
By, (0) let d := dist(y,T) and let w €T be such that d= |y — w|.

From Corollary [L2] we can assume that 2d < ro. One of the following cases
is possible.

i d=0,yeT.

In this case we have that holds for r < ro by Theorem ZI]

ii, d=0,yeT!.

Here, (11) follows from the assumption C.

iii, d>0,w eT.

u solves Au = gi(x,u) in Byy2(y) for i = 1 or i = 2. Then, by the analysis
similar to the one in Corollary[L.2] we get that (II) holds for r < d/2.

17


iv. d>0,weTrl.
From Theorem [4.1] we have that
ju(z + w) — 2: Vu(w)| < Ch|2|? (12)

for |Vu(w)|/@0 < |z| < ro. On the other hand by assumption C we obtain
that (12) holds for |z| < |Vu(w)|/@. Hence, holds for all z such that
lz| < To.

By assumption A we have that

]Qy(u,7)|Iz2(aB10)) < Qy(u, 4/2)||n2(aB,(0)) + C(IID7 vi) Iloo +

for r < d/2.
Furthermore,

Hence from we get

u(y+ $2) =(y+ te —w) - Vu(w)
P/4

1Q,(u, d/2)||c2(aa,@) <

L?(0B1(0))

<C¢,
which yields
]Qu(u,r)|lz2(aB,e)) < C+ C(||D?viqylloo +1),
for r < d/2.

The previous analysis applies to the following example.

Example. Let g;(x,u) = A;(x) for i = 1,2, where A; are such that
i. Ai (x) — A2(x) > oo > 0 for all x € By;
ii. Ay (x), A2(x) are Holder continuous.

We recall from the introduction that under the stronger assumption inf, A, >
0, infg, —A2 > 0, this problem is studied in and the optimal interior
C1 regularity is established. The authors use a different approach based on
monotonicity formulas and an analysis of global solutions via a blow-up proce-
dure.

4.2 No-sign obstacle problem

Here we observe that assumption A implies that the solutions of (3) are in
C'(By/2). This theorem was proven in (Theorem 1.2) for the case
when g(x, t) depends only on x. Under assumption A, appropriate modifications
of the proof in work also for the general case; since the arguments are
similar, we provide only a sketch of the proof and highlight the differences.

Sketch of the proof of Theorem {1.4} Let P= {ys.t. u(y) = |Vu(y)| = 0}.
For r > 0 let A, := {a € By s.t. u(r) = 0} and d,. := |A,|.
The proof of Theorem 1.2 in consists of the following ingredients.

e Interior C1! estimate
e Quadratic growth away from the free boundary
e Proposition 5.1|

Let us recall that the interior C1! estimate is the inequality

Well zB) 4
Julosceyn) $C (llama + ED) (1s)
where Au(x) = g(x) for « € Ba and the Newtonian potential of g is C!!. This
estimate is purely a consequence of g having a C!! Newtonian potential.
Quadratic growth away from the free boundary is a bound

ju(x)| < Cdist(a,P)?. (14)

The first observation in is that if g(x,t) = g(x) has a C!! Newtonian
potential, then (14) and (13) yield C! regularity for the solution. Indeed, “far”
from the free boundary, the solution u solves the equation Au = g(x) and is
locally C1! by assumption. For points close to the free boundary, u solves the
same equation but now on a small ball centered at the point of interest and
touching the free boundary. At this point one invokes and by obtains
that the C!! bound does not blow up close to the free boundary (see Lemma
4.1 in [ALST3}).

To prove (14), the authors prove in Proposition 5.1 that if the
projection II,(u,7) (for some y € r) is large enough then the density 2, of the
coincidence set diminishes at an exponential rate. On the other hand, if 4,
diminishes in an exponential rate, II,(u,r) has to be bounded. Consequently,
by invoking Lemma[2Z.2] one obtains (14).

Now let g satisfy A.

e Interior C! estimate
In the general case, (13) is replaced by
Qu (u, s)llz2~av.(y) S Qu(u,r)\lc2(B,(0) + CUD? eu llc +), (15)

where 0 < s <r <d, Avyy) = g(x, u(y)) and Au = f(x,u) in Ba(y).
Estimate is purely a consequence of assumption A (see in the
proof of Theorem [LJ).

19


e {ALS13] Proposition 5.1]

In this proposition, it is shown that there exists C such that if II,(u,r) > C
then

Cc
M2 < —__~__l/2 16
2 VTy(w,.r)||b2(By) (06)

for some C > 0. The inequality is obtained by the decomposition

u(ra + y)

5 =Ily(u,r) + hp + wr,

r

where h,, w, are such that

Ah, = —g(ra+y)xa, in By,

h, =0 on OB,
and

Aw, = g(rz + y) in By,

Wp = uirety) —IL,(u,r) on OB,.
The authors show that

(17)
|D?wr||n=(B,)2) < C ((lgll ue + llulle(e,)) -
In the general case one may consider the decomposition
u(ra + y)
—= = Qy(u,r) + hp + wr + Zr
r

where h,, w,, Zp are such that

Ahy = —g(ra+y,0)xa, in Bi,

hy =0 on OBi,
and

Aw, = g(rz + y,0) in Bi,

Wr = uraty) —Q,(u,r) on OB,
and

Ax = (g(ra + y,u(re + y)) — g(rx +y,0))XB\a, in Bi,
Zp =0 on OB.
Evidently, estimates (17) are still valid. Additionally, we have
: 1
| D> =rllnace4/2) $ ClAzrllzaqa,) < Cul? log +), (18)

20


since g(x,t) is uniformly Dini in t.
Combining and (18) and arguing as in one obtains the exis-
tence of C' > 0 such that

‘ C >, 1
MM? < —__—__ I 4 (t+), 19
"2 Qy(ur)\|r2(on.) | rye ")

whenever ||Q,(u,7)||c2(aB,) = C.

Quadratic growth away from the free boundary
In [ALS13], the norms of I,(u,r/2"), k > 1 are estimated in terms of
0

the sum > Ar/2i- If the norms of projections are unbounded, one obtain
j=0

estimate (16) which implies convergence of the previous sum and hence

boundedness of the projections. This is a contradiction.

Similarly, in the general case the norms of Q,(u,r/2*), k > 1 can be

estimated by
oo oo .
r\2 ak
Dawa + ow ((=) log =) ;
j=0 j=0

Inequality (19) and Dini continuity imply

a ry\2, 2k ce
y+ ((z) iow) ; Do dy2! <0,

j=0

if the norms of projections are unbounded. Furthermore, one completes
the proof of the quadratic growth as in [ALS13].

To verify that the above ingredients imply C1! regularity, we split the
analysis into two cases. If we are “far” from the free boundary, wu locally
solves Au = g(x, u) so by Theorem 3.1 u is C1. If we are close to the free
boundary then u solves Au = g(x,u) in a small ball Bu(y) that touches
the free boundary. We invoke (15) for 0 < s < r = d/2 and the quadratic
growth to obtain

Qu(u, s)Ilz2(an,(0)) < lQy(u, d/2)||x2(aB,) + C(||D?euy) loo + 1)

d/2
<C uly + 4/22) + Ol||D?vu(yy loo + 1)
a? /4 1L2(0By)

< C+ O(||D?vuyylloo + 1)-

for s < d/2.

So there exists a constant C such that for all y € By/2 there exist radii
rj(y) > 0 such that

Q,(u, 75 (y)) <e.
We conclude via Lemma [2.6]
