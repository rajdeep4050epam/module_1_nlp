On the Backus average of layers with randomly oriented
elasticity tensors

Abstract

As shown by Backus (1962), the average of a stack of isotropic layers results in a transversely
isotropic medium. Herein, we consider a stack of layers consisting of a randomly oriented
anisotropic elasticity tensor, which—one might expect—would result in an isotropic medium.
However, we show—by means of a fundamental symmetry of the Backus average—that the
corresponding Backus average is only transversely isotropic and not, in general, isotropic. In
the process, we formulate, and use, a relationship between the Backus and Gazis et al. (1963)
averages.

1 Introduction

In this paper, we investigate the Backus (1962) average of a stack of anisotropic layers, wherein the
tensors are oriented randomly. In spite of a conceptual relation between randomness and isotropy,
herein, the Backus average results in a medium, whose anisotropy, even though weak, is irreducible
to isotropy, regardless of increasing randomness.

Each layer is expressed by Hooke’s law,

where the stress tensor, 0;; , is linearly related to the strain tensor,

is the elasticity tensor, which has to be positive-definite. Under the index symmetries, this tensor
has twenty-one linearly independent components, and can be written as (e.g., Béna et al., 2008,

Any elasticity tensor of this form is also positive-definite (e.g., Bona et al., 2007).

where g = [a, b, c, d] is a unit quaternion. The corresponding rotation of tensor (1) is (Béna et al.,

where A is expression (A.1) in Appendix A.

2 The Backus and Gazis et al. averages

To examine the elasticity tensors, C € R®°*®, which are positive-definite, let us consider the space
of all matrices M := R®°*® . Its subspace of isotropic matrices is

Miso >= {MEM : QMQT=M, VQ €SO(3)}.

Miso is a linear space, since, as is easy to verify, if My, M2 € Miso, then aM, + 8M2 € Miso, for
all a, 8 € R. Let us endow M with an inner product,

6
(Mi, Mz) p := tr(Ma Mg!) = S> (Mi)ij(Ma)is ,

ij=l

and the corresponding Frobenius norm,
M2 || = VM, Ma) re -

In such a context, Gazis et al. (1963) prove the following theorem.
Theorem 1. The closest element—with respect to the Frobenius norm—to M € M C Migo is
uniquely given by

Miso *= | QMGQT ao(Q),
50(3)

where do(Q) represents the Haar probability measure on SO(3) .


Proof. It suffices to prove that
M — Migg L Miso -

To do so, we let N € Migo be arbitrary. Then, for any A € SO(3),

(M = Miso ,N) p = tr ((M — Migo) NT)
= fe MQ? do(Q) | NT
SO(3)
= - [ aur do(Q) | NT AT (as Ais orthogonal)
Jf
_ fiw A | Q@MQ" do(Q) | AT (4n747)

But

A [ OeracQ) AT= | A(QMQ‘) AT da(Q) (by linearity)

S0(3) S0(3)

$0(3)

= | QMQT do(Q) (by the invariance of the measure)

Hence,
(M — Mio, N) p = tr (AM NTAT ) — Miso (4 NTAT )
(ANTAT) ~ Mis. (AN7AT))
NT — Mi N)
NT) = tr(MioN?) ,
as by assumption, N € Migo -
Finally, integrating over A € SO(3), we obtain

(M — Miso, N)p = tr | AMAT do(A) | NT | — tr(Miso N7)
SO(3)
= tr(Miso N7) — tr(Miso N7)
= 0,


as required.

Since any elasticity tensor, C' € , is positive-definite, it follows that

Cun =f FCT Ao(@)
SO(3)
is both isotropic and positive-definite, since it is the sum of positive-definite matrices QcQq’.
Hence, Ciso is the closest isotropic tensor to C', measured in the Frobenius norm.

If Q; € SO(3),i=1,...,n, is a sequence of random samples from S'O(3), then the sample means
converge almost surely to the true mean,

eer. oo

jim [QCA = | QCQ"ao(Q) = Cine (2)
id S0(3)

which—in accordance with Theorem 1—is the Gazis et al. average of C.

This paper relies on replacing the arithmetic average in expression (2) by the Backus average, which

provides a single, homogeneous model that is long-wave-equivalent to a thinly layered medium.

According to Backus (1962), the average of the function f(x3) of “width” ¢’ is the moving average
given by
oo
Flea) = f w(x) A(6) ac,

co

where the weight function, w(x3), acts like the Dirac delta centred at x3 = 0, and exhibits the
following properties.

°°

w(a3) >0, w(+too) =0, | w(x3)dr3 = 1, | x3 w(x3) dr3 = 0, | x3 w(x3) dz = (C)?.

—0o

These properties define w(a3) as a probability-density function with mean zero and standard devi-
ation ¢’ , thus explaining the term “width” for ¢’.

3. The block structure of C > ACAT

The action C - ACAT has a simple block structure that is exploited in Section 4. To see this,
we consider g = [a, 0,0, d], with a := cos(@/2), d := sin(@/2); thus, in accordance with expres-
sion (1),

cos@ —sind 0
A=A(q)= | sin@ cos? 0 (3)
0 0 1


and, in accordance with expression (A.1),

cos? @ sin? 6 0 0 Oo = a sin (20)
sin? 6 cos? @ 0 0 0 4 sin (20)
~ 0 0 1 0 0 0
A-
0 0 0 cos# sind 0
0 0 0 —sin@ cosé 0
Yq sin (26) -H sin(20) 0 0 0 cos (20)
For q = [0, 6, c, 0], with 6 := cos(@/2) and c := sin(0/2) ,
cos@ — sin® 0
A=A(q) =| sin@ -cos@ 0 (4)
0 0 -1
and
cos? @ sin? 6 0 0 0 Wa sin (20)
sin? 6 cos? @ 0 0 0 - Wa sin (20)
~ 0 0 1 0 0 0
A-
0 0 0 cos# —sin@ 0
0 0 0 —sin@ —cosé 0
Ya sin (26) -4 sin(20) 0 0 0 —cos (24)

In both cases permuting the rows and columns to the order (3, 4,5, 1, 2, 6) results in a diagonal
block structure for A. For expression (3), we have

0 As
where
1 0 0 cos? 6 sin? - wa sin (26)
A,=| 0 cosé sind and Ay = sin? 6 cos? Ww sin (20)
0 —sin@ cos@ fT

(20) -H sin (26) cos (26)

Both A;, Ap € R8* are rotation matrices. Similarly, for expression (4),

As|" 2),
0 Apo
herein, Ay, Ap € R°*? are reflection matrices. Thus, in both cases, A, and Ay are orthogonal

matrices.

In either case, the following lemma holds.

4 The fundamental symmetry of the Backus average

Let us examine properties of the Backus average, which—for elasticity tensors, C;—we denote by

(C1, ..-, En).

E Rox6 ;
A (Gis Cn) AT = (ACLAT,...,AC, AT), (5)

which is a symmetry condition. Conversely, if for an orthogonal matrix, A € R°*? , we have equal-
ity (5), for any collection of elasticity tensors, C1, ... , Cn € R°*®, then A must be of the form of
expression (3) or (4).

Proof. As in Lemma 2, we permute the rows and columns of C € R®*® to the order (3, 4,5, 1, 2,6).
Thus, we have the block structure

_| MB | 3x3,

c=[k i |: M,B,K,JeER”™;

herein, we use the notation of equations (5)—(9) of Bos et al. (2017). Also, A has the block structure

of

A= ~ |, Ar, A2€R™”,

and is orthogonal.

In particular,

which completes the proof of equality (5).

where A is given in expression (A.1). It can be shown by direct calculation that the (3,3) entry of B
is

Bag = 5 (142 (0 +02)? (a? +a*)’) . (10)
Since C) and C2 are multiples of the identity,
ACGAT=C, and AC,AT=Co,

and the Backus average of AC, AT and ACjAT equals the Backus average of Cy and C2, which is
matrix (8). Hence,

A(C,, C2) AT = (Acar, AGAT)

implies that, for expression (10),

which results in

21 2) (72 4 42
3 (b? + c*) (a? +d?) 0.
Thus, either b = c = 0 ora =d=0. This is a necessary condition for symmetry (5) to hold, as
claimed.

Remark 4. Theorem 3 is formulated for general positive-definite matrices C € R°*® , not all of

which represent elasticity tensors. However, expression (5) is continuous in the C; and hence is

true in general only if it is also true for C;, such as diagonal matrices, which are limits of elasticity
tensors.

5 The Backus average of randomly oriented tensors

In this section, we study the Backus average for a random orientations of a given tensor. As discussed
in Section 2, the arithmetic average of such orientations results in the Gazis et al. average, which
is the closest isotropic tensor with respect to the Frobenius norm. We see that—for the Backus
average—the result is, perhaps surprisingly, different.

Given an elasticity tensor, C € R°*®, let us consider a sequence of its random rotations given by
Cj) :=Q;CQ}, j=Hl,...,n,
where Q; € R°*? are random matrices sampled from SO(3) .

The C; are samples from some distribution and, hence, almost surely,

_ 1
Ci= di LG =(C),

the true mean,
woy= | QCQTaa(Q),
SO(3)

where do(Q) is Haar measure on SO(3). Note that ju(C) is just the Gazis et al. average of C’.


Similarly, for any expression X(C) of submatrices of C, which appear in the Backus-average formu-
las,

X= im = p(X).
j=

Hence, almost surely limn—yo. (Ci, ... , Cn) equals the Backus average formula with each expres-
sion X replaced by

W(X) = | X (Q;0.Q,7) do(Q).

Theorem 5. The limp .0(Ci,.-.,Cn) exists almost surely, in which case it is transversely
isotropic. It is not, in general, isotropic.

Proof. Let A € R°*? be an orthogonal matrix of type (3) or (4). Then

almost surely,

lim (Ci. ....n) = Jim (Gr. Gn) = B, say .

But by the symmetry property of the Backus average, Theorem 3,

(Ci...) Cn) =A (Gry Cn AT.
Thus oe
B=ABA’,

which means that B is invariant under a rotation of space by A. Consequently, B is a transversely
isotropic tensor.

In general, the limit tensor is not isotropic, as illustrated by the following example. Let

C =diag[1,1,1,1,0,0],

which, as stated in Remark 4, represents a limiting case of an elasticity tensor. Numerical evidence
strongly suggests that

+ + +000
PE L000
pu} i 7 2 9 0 0
00000 0
00000 0
00000 4

which is not isotropic.

10


Although this is rather an artificial example, it could—with some computational effort—be “pro-
moted” to a legal proof. The conclusion is readily confirmed by the numerical examples presente
in Section 6.

In fact, it is easy to identify the limiting matrix B; it is just the Backus average expression (7), with
an expression X(C) replaced by the true mean

wx(Q) = [ X(GCQ") aa(Q). (11)
s0(3)
This limiting transversely isotropic tensor is of natural interest in its own right. It plays the role of

the Gazis et al. average in the context of the Backus average, and is the subject of a forthcoming
work.

6 Numerical example

Let us consider the elasticity tensor obtained by Dewangan and Grechka (2003); its components are
estimated from seismic measurements in New Mexico,

7.8195 3.4495 2.5667 V2(0.1374)  V2(0.0558) /2 (0.1239)

(12)

Using tensor (12), let us demonstrate two methods to obtain B and their mutual convergence in the
limit.
The first method to obtain B requires a stack of layers, whose elasticity tensors are C. We rotate
each C’, using a random unit quaternion, and perform the Backus average of the resulting stack of
layers. Using 107 layers, the Backus average is

7.3008 2.9373 2.9379 V2 (0.0000) V2(0.0000) V2 (0.0000)

2.9373 7.3010 2.9381 ¥2(0.0000) V2(0.0000) V2 (0.0000)

V2 (0.0000) V2(0.0000) V2(—0.0001) 2(0.0000) 2 (2.1710) 2 (0.0000)

V2 (0.0000) V2(0.0000) V2(0.0000) — 2(0.0000) 2 (0.0000) 2 (2.1819)

(13)
For an explicit formulation of the Backus average of generally anisotropic media, see Bos et al. (2017,
expressions (5)—(9)).

The second method requires integrals in place of arithmetic averages. Similarly to the first method,
we use a random unit quaternion, which is tantamount to a point on a 3-sphere. We approximate
the triple integral using Simpson’s and trapezoidal rules. Effectively, the triple integral is replaced
by a weighted sum of the integrand evaluated at discrete points. The sums that approximate the
integrals are accumulated and are used in expressions (7).

(14)
In the limit, the components of expressions (13) and (14) are the same; their similarity is illustrated
in Figure 1, where the horizontal axis is the number of layers and the vertical axis is the maximum
componentwise difference between the two tensors.
Expression (14) is transversely isotropic, as expected from Theorem 5, and in accordance with Béna
et al. (2007, Section 4.3), since its four distinct eigenvalues are

Ay = 18.1658, Ap = 4.3412, Az = 4.3636, Ay = 4.3421, (15)

with multiplicities of my = m2 = 1 and m3 = m4 = 2. The eigenvalues of expression (13) are in
agreement—up to 10~*—with eigenvalues (15) and their multiplicities. Furthermore, in accordance
with Theorem 5, in the limit, the distance to the closest isotropic tensor for expression (14) is
0.0326 A 0; thus the distance does not reduce to zero.

Expressions (13) and (14) are transversely isotropic, which is the main conclusion of this work, even
though, for numerical modelling, one might view them as isotropic. This is indicated by Thomsen
(1986) parameters, which for tensor (14) are

7 = 2.4768 x 107°, 6 = 1.5816 x 1073, e = 2.2219 x 1073;

values much less than unity indicate very weak anisotropy.

7 Conclusions and future work

Examining the Backus average of a stack of layers consisting of randomly oriented anisotropic elastic-
ity tensors, we show that—in the limit—this average results in a homogeneous transversely isotropic
medium, as stated by Theorems 3 and 5. In other words, the randomness within layers does not
result in a medium lacking a directional pattern. Both the isotropic layers, as shown by Backus
(1962), and randomly oriented anisotropic layers, as shown herein, result in the average that is

12


transversely isotropic, as a consequence of inhomogeneity among parallel layers. This property is
discussed by Adamus et al. (2018), and herein it is illustrated in Appendix B.

In the limit, the transversely isotropic tensor is the Backus counterpart of the Gazis et al. average.
Indeed, the arithmetic average of randomized layers of an elasticity tensor produces the Gazis et
al. average and is its closest isotropic tensor, according to the Frobenius norm. On the other hand,
the Backus average of the layers resulting from a randomization of the same tensor produces the
transversely isotropic tensor given in expression (11). This tensor and its properties are the subject
of a forthcoming paper.
