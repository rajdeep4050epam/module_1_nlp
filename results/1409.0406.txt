Abstract. We derive a set of bilinear identities for the determinants of the matrices
that have been used to construct the dark soliton solutions for various models. To give
examples of the application of the obtained identities we present soliton solutions for
the equations describing multidimensional quadrilateral lattices, Darboux equations
and multidimensional multicomponent systems of the nonlinear Schrédinger type.

1. Introduction.

It has been known since the 1970s that solutions of various integrable equations possess
similar structure. Probably the brightest illustration of this fact is the so-called direct
approach elaborated by Hirota, who i) noted that integrable equations can be reduced
to a special, bilinear, form and ii) proposed the famous ansatz to solve the latter.
The universality of this ansatz even gave rise to the search for other equations that
can be solved in a similar way, which successfully resulted in the discovery of many
new integrable models. Later, similar approach, when one starts from the structure of
solutions instead of, for example, constructing the inverse scattering transform, provided
a wide range of classes of particular solutions built from determinants (Wronskians,
Casoratians, determinants of Toeplitz or Hankel matrices, etc) or Pfaffians. A large
number of works is devoted to the (quasi)periodic solutions of integrable systems. Most
of them are based on a modification of the inverse scattering method or the so-called
algebro-geometric approach. The last method, which has been developed for almost
all known integrable systems, exploits some rather sophisticated pieces of the theory of
functions of complex variables. However, in many cases these solutions can be found
with less effort, in a more straightforward way. One can find in [I] or [21/3] [4,5] examples
of how to construct the ‘finite-genus’ explicit solutions by means of the so-called Fay
identities [I] [6] for the 6-functions associated with compact Riemann surfaces using
calculations that seem elementary if compared with the ‘full-scale’ algebro-geometric

approach.


Soliton Fay identities. I. Dark soliton case. 2

In all of the above cases we have different realizations of the direct approach that
can be summarized as follows. One starts with the known structure of the solution
(Hirota ansatz, combinations of Wronski/Casorati/Toeplitz/Hankel determinants or 6-
functions). Next, one has to determine some parameters and to demonstrate that
this choice of parameters meets the equation in question. To do this one uses some
identities related to the objects involved in the ansatz (the identities from Hirota
calculus, ‘classical’ determinant identities or Fay identities for the 6-functions).

The aim of this work is to simplify the direct approach for solitons. We study some
properties of the matrices that have been used in [bj [7] [8 [9 (10) [11] to construct the
dark soliton solutions for various models and derive some identities that are satisfied by
these matrices and that can be viewed as soliton analogues of the Fay identities.

In the title of the paper (and throughout its text) we use the term ‘dark
soliton’ which is usually associated with localized objects existing against plane wave
backgrounds or, from the mathematical viewpoint, solutions satisfying non-vanishing
finite-density (i.e. with constant or bounded modulus) boundary conditions. This
usage is somewhat dubious because we, first, do not discuss below the boundary value

problems. Second, in examples in section [6] we present solutions with unbounded
background (though they can be made bounded by admitting complex parameters,
the question that, again, we do not discuss in this paper). Finally, our approach may
lead to the so-called anti-dark solitons. Nevertheless, we use this term i) to indicate that
the identities which are particular cases of the Fay identities presented below have been
used to obtain dark soliton solutions for various models and ii) to distinguish the case
of this paper from the bright soliton case (with zero boundary conditions) where soliton
matrices/determinants and, hence, Fay identities have similar but different structures
and which will be studied in the second part of this work.

We start with introducing in section 2]a class of matrices than can be called ‘dark
soliton matrices’. By simple algebra we deduce the set of bilinear identities that are
satisfied by the determinants of these matrices (section 3), present their alternative
formulations (section 4) and their differential versions (section [5). We discuss a few
applications of the obtained identities in section [6] where we use them to construct

solutions for the equations describing multidimensional lattices, Darboux equations and
multicomponent equations of the nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) type.

2. Dark soliton matrices.

2.1. Notation
The central objects of our study are the determinants

Q(A) = det |1 + A] (2.1)
and the shifts that are defined as

TeQ(A) = det |1 + AHe| (2.2)


Soliton Fay identities. I. Dark soliton case. 3

where H¢ is the constant diagonal matrix defined by,

He = (C= L)(C-R)* (2.3)
with constant diagonal matrices L, R and unit matrices being omitted: ¢ — L stands for
¢1—Lete.

To simplify the following formulae we use the ‘set’ notation, X = {&1,...,€,}, with
|...| standing for the number of elements of the set, |X| = n, and basic set operations

denoted as XY = XU Y, CX = X¢ = {C} UX and X/& = {H,..., €&,-.-En}. We use the
set indices to indicate the superposition of the shifts,

Tx = [[T: 2.4)
EEX
or

TxQ(A) = det |1 + AHx| 2.5)

where

Hx = | [ He. 2.6)

€eX
Sometimes, when the matrix A is fixed, we do not write the A-dependence of 2 explicitly
and use an alternative notation for the shifted determinants,

Q(X] = Tx = det |1 + AHx|. (2.7)

2.2. Rank one condition.

In the following sections we derive the identities for the determinants of the so-called
‘almost-intertwining’ matrices [12] that satisfy the ‘rank one condition’ [13}{14,[15), which
is a particular case of the Sylvester equation (see [16] {17]). We write this condition as

LA — AR = | £) (al. (2.8)
Here, | £) is a constant N-component column, |) = (¢;,...,€y)", (a| is an N-component
row, (a| = (a), ...,a@y). From the viewpoint of applications, namely vectors (a| determine
the dependence of the matrices A on the coordinates describing the model we are dealing
with.
One of the consequences of (2.8) is the following

Proposition 1 The shifted determinants (2.1) can be presented as

TeQ(A) = Q(A) [1 + (al (R — 6) *G(A)| €)] , (2.9)

Te'Q(A) = Q(A) [1 — (alG(A)(L — ¢)"| £)] (2.10)
where

G(A) = (1+A)7?. (2.11)

The proof of these statements is presented in

The following result plays a crucial role in the derivation of the soliton Fay identities.

Proposition 2 If matrices X and Y are given by

X = AHx, Y = AHy (2.12)
where X and Y are two arbitrary sets, then

(T2(X)) (Tz'@(Y)) = MEKJA(Y) [1+ (YIG(Y/Dxv(G)GOK)|E)]}— (2.13)
with (y| = (a|Hy and

Dxy(¢) = HxHy! (R—¢)' — (L-Q) (2.14)

(see [Appendix B] for a proof).

2.3. Derivation of the main identity.

The significance of proposition 2] is that it ‘extracts’ the dependence on ¢ outside
the determinants and demonstrates that the left-hand side of (2.13) is a meromorphic
function of ¢. Now we use the elementary formula for the quotient of the polynomials,

Qt) _ S Ci (2.15

Pi) Stn
where P(t) = J]}_,(t — m), Q(£) is a polynomial whose degree is less than n an
c = Q(ni)/P'(m) which we rewrite as
Alt.X) _ ya Py(XY) A(n.X)
= T,(X, Y) = ————~ 2.16
BEY) Qe tay Y= BY (
with
At,Y)=[[(t-n), AG Y)=T][][[«-»). (2.17
ney €€X neY
It follows from (2.16) anc that, in the case of |X| < |Y|,
So Te(X, Y)Dxv(6) = Hey! A(R, X)A“'U(R, Y) — AW, AHL) (2.18
ceY
which leads, together with Hx A(R, X) = A(L, X), to
SE e(X, Y)Dxv(¢) = 0. (2.19
ceY
Another consequence of (2.16) is that in the case of |X| < |Y|
DIP C(X, Y) = Sixty (2.20
ceY
which, together with (2.13), implies
So P(X, Y) (TeX) (TEO(Y)) = dixpyyj@OQUY). (2.21
ceY

Noting that

TeQ(X) = Tex(A) (2.22


Soliton Fay identities. I. Dark soliton case. 5
and

Te'Q(Y) = TycQ(A) for CEY (2.23)
one can rewrite the last identity as

SETH Y) (TyxQ(A)) (Tym (A) = dxjsriy) (PxQ(A)) (TyQ(A)) (2.24)

3. Fay identities.

3.1. The main identity.

Hereafter, we fix the ‘base’ matrix A, do not write it explicitly and use notation (2.7).
Statement (2.24), which is the main identity of this paper, can be formulated as

Proposition 3 For any sets X and Y, |X| < |Y|, the shifted determinants 0,

Q[X] = det |1 + AHx|, 3.1)
satisfy the following bilinear identity:
dixjayy OLX] QLY] = SOT, (X,Y) Q[Xn] OY /y] 3.2)
neY
where
A(n, X)
r,(X, Y) = ———... 3.3)
" A(n, Y/n)
It is easy to see that equation (8.2) is a straightforward generalization of the famous
Hirota bilinear difference equation [18] (when |X| +1 < |Y|) or the Miwa equation
(when |X|+1= |Y|). Thus, proposition 3] states that we have obtained the dark soliton

solutions for the Hirota and Miwa equations.

3.2. Subset identities.

To make visible the ‘combinatorial’ aspects of the Fay identities, it is instructive to

introduce the function
Q[X] Q[Y]

0(X, Y) = ————. A
OY) =a (3.4)

In terms of ©, which has the property
(X,Y) = (-)“"'@(Y,X), (3.5)

the main identity looks like
(—)ixiai®(X% Y) = $2 &(X,Y/n) (|X| < [Y)). (3.6)
ney

Choosing some set Z as ‘universal’ one and taking complementary X and Y,
XUY = Z, one can derive from the above equation that, if n meets N +1 < 2n,

n< N where N = |Z|, then

xa(Z.X) = D7 x(CX). (3.8)
Cez/X
Analyzing (8.7) in the case when y is the characteristic function, y(X) = |X|, one can
deduce
So O(Z/X,X)=0  (1<n<N-1, N32). (3.9)

A more general result can be obtained for any additive y, y(XY) = x(X) + x(Y). In
this case

xi(Z, X) = x(Z) + (I2Z| — |X| — Y) xX) (3.10)
and (8.7) together with (8.9) imply that function
Fy = Yo x(X)®(Z/X,X) (3.11)

From this equations and

Fy_n _ (-)P-D+1 BF (3.13)
which follows from the definition of F,,, one can easily obtain that F,, = 0 for
2<n<N-2, or

So x(X)@(Z/X,X)=0 (2<n<N-2, N>4). (3.14)

Returning to the determinants Q[X], one arrives at

4. Miwa shifts.

One of the methods used to tackle integrable models is the so-called functional
representation when an infinite set of integrable equations (a hierarchy) is presented
as a functional equation or a finite set of functional equations which are usually written
in terms of the Miwa shifts. These shifts are defined by

Be f(tedlnan = F(te + C*/k) (4.1)
where € is a constant (usually, 1 of 7).
From the definition of the matrices Hq (2.3) it is clear that the shifts T, can play the
role of the Miwa shifts, or give rise to the continuous flows, only near the point a = oo
(otherwise one cannot meet the condition limg_,9E¢ = 1), which restricts universality
of the presented Fay identities. More flexible approach is to model the Miwa shifts as

E, = TaT,! (4.2)

where « is some fixed (constant) parameter, that leads to the typical presentation of Eq
as a power series E, = 1+ (a —)"D, where D,, are some differential operators.
In this section we rewrite the main identity (8.2) and its consequences in terms of

the operators or, more generally,
Ey = [[E.=TaT,", (4.3)

Considering various ways of constructing sets X and Y of K, = { ROR}, A and B, with
« ¢ A,B one can derive various E-identities. For example, taking X = B, Y = KA with
|A| = |B] +n, n = 1,2,3 one can rewrite (3.2) as

(Ea) (En) = S71 70(A,B) (Eajo®)(Eon® = (|A| = [BI +1) (44
(Eq) (EpQ) = Saal B) (Ea/o)(Eon®) = (JAJ= [BJ +2) (4.5
(Ea)(Ep®) = Tals B) (Eaja®)(Eon®) (AJ = [BI +2) (4.6
(E42) (Ep) = Saal B) (Ea/o)(Eas®) (JAY =|BJ +3) (47

acA
where
Q = T,Q, Q=T70 4.8
and
A(a,B) A(K, A/a)
A(a, A/a) A(k,B)
From the above formulae one can obtain a set of ‘homogeneous’ equations by replacing

B with BK,,:

0= So ra(A, B)(a — x) ATP (By j.2)(Ean®) (|Al > |B] +1), (4.10)
acA

Ya(A, B) = 4.9

0 = So ra(A, B)(a — 6) OPI? (Eajo9)(Ean®) (Al > |B] +2), (4-11)
acA

0= So ra(A, B)(a — 6) PI ?(Ey/.9)(Ean®) (|| > |B] +2), (4-12)
acA

0= So y0(A, B)(a — «)/AIIBI3 (By ,0)(Eon®)  (|A| > |B] +3). (4.13)
acA
In a similar way, (8.2) with X = B, Y = «A and |A| = |B| leads, after replacing
B > BK,, and applying the shift Tz!, to
A(k, A)

for |A| > |B].

Looking at the above equations, one can see the appearance of the triplet 2, Q, Q
instead of Q. This situation is typical for the ‘complex’ NLS-like models. Indeed, these
models are formulated in terms of two functions g and r, which are related in physical
applications by r = +g (bar stands for the complex conjugation). To bilinearize NLS-

like equations one usually has to employ three tau-functions o, 7 and p: q = a/T,
r = p/r with involution p = +¢ and t = 7. It was shown in the previous works by
the author that in the dark soliton case the universal way to construct the chain (finite
or infinite) of the tau functions ... + p> T > 0 — ... is to use the T,, shifts, 7 x Q,
pn T,,'Q, a «x T,Q, etc, with some distinguished yz. In particular, the case of this
section, 4 = & where & is the ‘base’ of the Miwa shifts, corresponds, as is shown in [10],
to the the positive (classical) part of the AKNS hierarchy.

Construction can be extended to introduce other sets of Miwa shifts by
changing the ‘base’ shift parameter «. In the previous works the author used two
sets,

E, = TaT,', Ey, = T,T;’, KAR (4.16)

to deal with extended hierarchies consisted of positive, E, and negative, E,
subhierarchies.

More generally, one can introduce several Miwa shifts and, hence, several systems of
continuous flows, E Ge = ToT, to deal with multidimensional equations and hierarchies.

We do not present here the corresponding identities because it seems difficult to
select from possible variants some reasonable set of ‘ready-to-use’ formulae.

5. Differential Fay identities.

The differential Fay identities can be derived using the standard limit procedure. First
we define the differential operator 0, by

, x (TeT,' — 1). (5.1)

Oy = lim

Then, considering, as in the case of the Miwa shifts, various ways of constructing sets X
and Y of A, €, A and B, with \,€ ¢ A,B and taking the € > limit one can obtain from

the main identity (8.2) various bilinear equations involving OQ) or its bilinear analogue,

Dyu-v = (Qu) vu —u(dv). (5.2)
We present here only the general one, that can be written for the case |A| + 1 > |B] as
A(A, B)

and

together with the Toda-like identity of the second order,
ao QAR] Q[pA] +e? 5.6
where c is a constant that is usually determined from the boundary conditions.

From the practical viewpoint, the differential identities (5.3) are to be combined
with the ‘algebraic’ ones, (8.2) or formulae from section 4] to present the right-hand side
of (5.3) as a ‘physical’ combination of the tau functions 2. One can find a few examples

Dy, -Q =

of application of differential Fay identities in the next section.

6. Applications.

In this section we discuss applications of the Fay identities derived in this paper. We
would like to note that particular cases of the formulae of the previous sections have
already been used by the author in previous works [5} [7] |8} [9] (10, [TI], that may be
considered as the ‘most practical’ examples.

Here we focus on the models that can be viewed as extensions of the ‘classical’
integrable models. The main feature of all equations presented below is that they are
multidimensional, contrary to most of the ‘classical’, or integrable by means of the
standard inverse scattering transform, models that are 2- or (1 + 1)-dimensional.

where {ec} is an arbitrary set of vectors from an arbitrary space V. Equation (65) can
now be rewritten as
(Tx = 1) fy, = So anex (Te - 1) fy. (6.8)

It is clearly seen that the simplest case of (6.8), |X| = 2, describes multidimensional
quadrilateral lattices (QL) in V [20] [21] [22]. Thus, we have demonstrated that the
determinants 2 provide solutions for the generalized QL equation (6.8), that can be
viewed as a compatible system of several classical (two-dimensional) QL equations.

that generalize the discrete Darboux equations,

The multidimensional QL and discrete Darboux equations were studied by various

authors who obtained their Grammian- and Casorati-type determinant [23] [24], the

algebro-geometric [25} |26) [27] and the soliton solutions [15} [28]. The results presented in

this section can be viewed as a simplification and generalization of the Cauchy matrix
approach elaborated in [28].

6.2. Darbouxr equations.

The next three examples are the differential systems, which are consequences of (5.3).

.3. (1+ N)-dimensional NLS-like system.

The first two examples discussed above are ‘general’ ones, in the sense that no
restrictions are imposed on the matrices L and R determining, through (2.8), the matrices
A which are used to construct the determinants Q . However, as can be seen from
[5] (7, {8} (9) (LO) [11], to build solutions for the NLS-like system one has to use L and R
that are not independent, which is a manifestation of the fact that dark solitons are
one-parametric (contrary to the two-parametric bright ones). For example, in 11]
L =R-!. Here, we use generalization of this condition that leads to the generalized
NLS-like equations.

Consider a fixed set of parameters

To summarize, we have demonstrated that functions defined by are solutions
of the (1+ .N)-dimensional NLS-like system (6.32) and (6.33). To present the N,-soliton
solutions for this model one has to rewrite formulae of this section, together with the

‘evolution’ equation for the matrix A following from (5.1),

In the above formulae, we use (a, b) to denote the standard scalar product of vectors @
and b and presume that basis {e;} is orthogonal.

To conclude this section we would like to comment the dark-soliton character of
the presented solution. It is easy to see from the structure of the matrix A that for the
vector No such that exp{(wg, 9)} is, say, positive for all 8 the elements of A(t, kno)
tend to 0 (when & — —oo) or to the infinity (when k + +00). Thus, det |1 + A(¢, kno)|
tends to 1 or is given by det |A(t, kno)| + O(1), which implies that

where Wiot = mn w,. Interpreting e“* as a background (it can be made usual plane
wave by taking pure imaginary u;) one can see the typical ‘dark soliton’ picture: a
background solution in the asymptotic regions, nontrivial behaviour in the region of
finite n’s and a constant ‘phaseshift’, — (wor, ei).

6.4. (1+2)-dimensional lattice with saturable nonlinearity.

In this example we slightly modify calculations of the previous section and discuss a
model with saturating nonlinearity.
Consider three shifts Te, € € {,v, K} related by

T,T, =T,.- (6.46

The differential Fay identity (5.3) with A = {u,v} and B = 0 under restriction (6.46

equations (6.47) and (6.48) can be written as

— pg =P. Tyq+ PL Ty (6.53

por =P, T,'r+P,T,'r (6.54
where

p=V(u-K)(v—k). (6.55

To close this system one has to relate P, and P, with q and r. This can be done using
the observation

T,Q=T,'Q, T,'Q = T,2 (6.56)
which leads to
P, = —P, (Ty'q) (Tyr). (6.57)

This, together with
P,+P,=1, (6.58)
that follows from the main Fay identity (8.2) for X = {«} and Y = {y, v} after applying

the shift T1, implies

where dot stands for d/dt.
To conclude, we write the ‘final’ formulae for the N,-soliton solutions. We restrict
ourselves with the case « = 0 (other choice, « 4 0, leads to rescaling of the time an

redefinition of constant parameters). Condition (6.46) leads to

v=p, R=L}, p=l. (6.62

Noting that H,, = L? one can write q and r in the following form:
u(in) det |L+ A (t, 2) P|
det |1 + A (t, n)|
—u(tn) det |L + A (t, 2) L-?|
det |1 + A (t, n)|

7. Conclusion.

The main result of this work is the set of bilinear identities that can be viewed as soliton
analogues of the Fay identities and which, in our opinion, are useful from the practical
viewpoint. First, they simplify the procedure of constructing soliton solutions. It has
been demonstrated in the previous works of the author as well as in examples provided
above that starting from (8.2), (6.3) or the formulae from section [4] one can obtain by
simple algebra explicit solutions for a wide range of equations such as, e.g, equations from
the NLS hierarchy [10], from the derivative NLS hierarchy [11], equations that describe
multidimensional QL, discrete and differential Darboux equations (see examples from
sections and [6.2) etc.

Another application of the obtained Fay identities is for a search for new solvable
models, especially in multidimensions. Two examples of apparently new equations can
be found in sections [6.3] and [6.4] Of course, we cannot, at present, say anything about
integrability of (6.32), (6.33) or (6.60) and (6.61). However, the fact that these systems
admit the N-soliton solutions is an indication that they are integrable (or at least admit

integrable reductions, as in the case studied in [4]). Surely, examples from sections [6.3]

and do not exhaust all interesting (both from the viewpoint of integrability and
of possible physical applications) models that can be solved by means of the identities
discussed in this paper and we hope to find more in future.

Finally, we would like to mentioned the most straightforward continuation of this
work: to derive the Fay identities for the bright soliton case. It is interesting that usually
the dark solitons are considered as more ‘difficult’ objects than the bright ones. This
is probably because of the fact that to derive them in the framework of the inverse
scattering transform one has to study the spectral problems with nonvanishing at the

infifnity potentials, which indeed complicates the involved mathematics. However, in
the framework of the direct approach, the situation can be inverted. For example, the

structure of the o-7-p triplet for the complex models turns out to be more complicated
in the bright soliton case than the Q-Q-2 construction that appears in section [4] This
and other questions related to the bright soliton Fay identities will be discussed in the

forthcoming paper.

Appendix A. Proof of proposition [I]

The aim of this section is to prove equations (2.9) and (2.10), which are straightforward

consequences of (2.8). Considering the

et

1+A(L—Q)(R-O)"|
1+(L—Q)A(R-¢) "|
1+ (A(R—¢) +|£)(al) (R-¢) "|
1+A+|£)(a|(R—¢) "|

det |1 + G(A)| £) (al (R— 6) "|.

The last expression, together with

det 2 +|u)(u| =1+(vlu)

leads to (2.9).

In a similar way,

TeIOQ(A) = det [1+ A(R—¢)(L— 0)" |

= det |1+(L-¢) 'A(R-6)|
= det 1+ (L— 0)" ((L- QA — | £) (al)|
= det [1+ A—(L— 0)" | £)(al|

= (A) det [1 — G(A) (L = 07" | 6)(al|

which implies (2.10).

Appendix B. Proof of proposition [2]

To prove (2.13), we use (2.9)

and (2.10) in the following form

TeQ(X) = Q(X) [1 + (2|(R — ¢)*G(X)| 2]
Te A(Y) = ACY) [1 = (yIG(Y)(L = 6)“ €)]

where

(2| = (alHx,

(y| = (alHy

first of them, one can write

Fxy(0) = 14+ (ylG(Y) Dxy(C)G(X)| ¢). B.5
To do this we use, when necessary,

(| = (y|HxHy" = (y|G(Y) (1+ Y) Hx Hy" B.6
and

|£) = (14+ X) G(X)| £2). B.7
Thus,

Dxy(G) = (L+Y)HxHy! (R=) § = (L=() "(1 +X)
—(L=g)* |e) (al (R=). (B.8)
Replacing YHxHy" with X one arrives at
Dxy(G) = HxHy! (R= 6) * = (L= 0)!
+(L—G) 1 [(L-Q)X-X(R—)—Jé)(el](R-G)) (B9)
Noting that the expression inside the square brackets vanishes by virtue of (2.8) one can
rewrite (B.5) as
Fry(Q) = 1+ (ylG(Y)Pxy(C)G(X)| ) (B.10)
which ends the proof of (2.13).
